    <t>This document specifies a distributed algorithm for automatic prefix assignment. Given a set of delegated prefixes, it ensures that at most one prefix is assigned from each delegated prefix to each link. Nodes may assign available prefixes to the links they are directly connected to, or for other private purposes.

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
    
    <t>This document specifies a distributed algorithm for automatic prefix assignment. Given a set of delegated prefixes, nodes may assign available prefixes to links they are directly connected to, or for their private use. The algorithm ensures that the following assertions are eventually true:
        <list style="numbers">
            <t>At most one prefix from each delegated prefix is assigned to each link.</t>
            <t>Assigned prefixes are not included in and do not include other assigned prefixes.</t>
            <t>Assigned prefixes do not change in the absence of topology or configuration changes.</t>
        </list>
        In the rest of this document the two first conditions are referred to as the correctness conditions of the algorithm while the third condition is referred to as its convergence condition.
    </t>
    
    <t>Each assignment has a priority specified by the node making the assignment, allowing for more advanced assignment policies. When multiple nodes assign different prefixes from the same delegated prefix to the same link, or when multiple nodes assign overlapping prefixes, the assignment with the highest priority is kept and other assignments are removed.</t>
    
    <t>The prefix assignment algorithm requires that participating nodes share information through a flooding mechanism. If the flooding mechanism ensures that all messages are propagated to all nodes faster than a given timing upper bound, the algorithm also ensures that all assigned prefixes used for networking operations (e.g., host configuration) remain unchanged, unless another node assigns an overlapping prefix with a higher assignment priority, or the topology changes and renumbering cannot be avoided.</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
    <t>In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "OPTIONAL",

    <t>
        This document makes use of the following terminology:
        <list style="hanging">
            
            <t hangText="Node: ">An entity executing the algorithm specified in this document and able to communicate with other nodes using the Flooding Mechanism.</t>
            
            <t hangText="Link: ">An object the distributed algorithm will assign prefixes to. A Node may only assign prefixes to Links it is directly connected to. A Link is either Shared or Private.</t>
            
            <t hangText="Private Link: ">A Private Link is an abstract concept defined for the sake of this document. It allows nodes to make assignments for their private use or delegation. For instance, every DHCPv6-PD <xref target='RFC3633' /> requesting router MAY be considered as a different Private Link.</t>
            
            <t hangText="Shared Link: ">A Link multiple nodes may be connected to. Most of the time, a Shared Link is a multi-access link or point-to-point link, virtual or physical, requiring prefixes to be assigned to it.</t>
            
            <t hangText="Delegated Prefix: ">A prefix provided to the algorithm and used as a prefix pool for Assigned Prefixes.</t>
            
            <t hangText="Node ID: ">A value identifying a given participating node. The set of identifiers MUST be strictly and totally ordered (e.g., using the alphanumeric order).</t>
            
            <t hangText="Flooding Mechanism: ">A mechanism allowing participating nodes to reliably share information with all other participating nodes.</t>
            
            <t hangText="Flooding Delay: ">Value which SHOULD be provided by the Flooding Mechanism indicating a deterministic or likely upper bound of the information propagation delay. When the Flooding Mechanism does not provide a value, it is set to <xref target='variables' >DEFAULT_FLOODING_DELAY</xref>.</t>
            
            <t hangText="Advertised Prefix: ">A prefix advertised by another node and delivered to the local node by the Flooding Mechanism. It has an Advertised Prefix Priority and, when assigned to a directly connected Shared Link, is associated with a Shared Link.</t>
            
            <t hangText="Advertised Prefix Priority: ">A value that defines the priority of an Advertised Prefix received from the Flooding Mechanism or a published Assigned Prefix. Whenever multiple Advertised Prefixes are conflicting, all Advertised Prefixes but the one with the greatest priority will eventually be removed. In case of tie, the assignment advertised by the node with the greatest Node ID is kept and others are removed. In order to ensure convergence, the range of priority values MUST have an upper bound.</t>
            
            <t hangText="Assigned Prefix: ">A prefix included in a Delegated Prefix and assigned to a Shared or Private Link. It represents a local decision to assign a given prefix from a given Delegated Prefix to a given Link. The algorithm ensures that there never is more than one Assigned Prefix per Delegated Prefix and Link pair. When destroyed, an Assigned Prefix is set as not applied, ceases to be advertised, and is removed from the set of Assigned Prefixes.</t>
            
            <t hangText="Applied (Assigned Prefix): ">When an Assigned Prefix is applied, it MAY be used (e.g., for host configuration, routing protocol configuration, prefix delegation). When not applied, it MUST NOT be used for any other purposes than the prefix assignment algorithm. Each Assigned Prefix is associated with a timer (Apply Timer) used to apply the Assigned Prefix. An Assigned Prefix is unapplied when destroyed.</t>
            
            <t hangText="Published (Assigned Prefix): ">The Assigned Prefix is advertised through the Flooding Mechanism as assigned to its associated Link. A published Assigned Prefix MUST have an Advertised Prefix Priority. It will appear as an Advertised Prefix to other nodes, once received through the Flooding Mechanism.</t>
            
            <t hangText="Prefix Adoption: ">When an Advertised Prefix which does not conflict with any other Advertised Prefix or published Assigned Prefix stops being advertised, any other node connected to the same Link MAY, after some random delay, start advertising the same prefix. This procedure is called adoption and provides seamless assignment transfer from a node to another, e.g., in case of node failure.</t>
            
            <t hangText="Backoff Timer: ">Every Delegated Prefix and Link pair is associated with a timer counting down to zero. It is used to avoid multiple nodes from making colliding assignments by delaying the creation of new Assigned Prefixes or the advertisement of adopted Assigned Prefixes by a random amount of time.</t>
        
            <t hangText="Renumbering: ">Event occurring when an Assigned Prefix which was applied is destroyed. It is undesirable as it usually implies reconfiguring routers or hosts.</t>

<section title="Applicability statement">
    
    <t>Each node MUST have a set of disjoint Delegated Prefixes (i.e., which do not include each other). This set MAY change over time and be different from one node to another at some point, but nodes MUST eventually have the same set of disjoint Delegated Prefixes.</t>
    <!-- Otherwise correctness is not ensured -->
    
    <t>Given this set of disjoint Delegated Prefixes, nodes may assign available prefixes from each Delegated Prefix to the Links they are directly connected to. The algorithm ensures that at most one prefix from a given Delegated Prefix is assigned to a given Link.</t>
    
    <t>The algorithm can be applied to any address space and can be used to manage multiple address spaces simultaneously. For instance, an implementation can make use of IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses <xref target='RFC4291' /> in order to manage both IPv4 and IPv6 prefix assignment using a single prefix space.</t>
    
    <t>The algorithm supports dynamically changing topologies:
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>Nodes may join or leave the set of participating nodes.</t>
            <t>Nodes may join or leave Links.</t>
            <t>Links may be joined or split.</t>
        </list>
    </t>
    
    <t>All nodes MUST run a common Flooding Mechanism in order to share published Assigned Prefixes. The set of participating nodes is defined as the set of nodes participating in the Flooding Mechanism.</t>
    
    <t>The Flooding Mechanism MUST:
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>Provide a way to flood Assigned Prefixes assigned to a directly connected Link along with their respective Advertised Prefix Priority and the Node ID of the node which advertises it.</t>
            <t>Specify whether an Advertised Prefix was assigned to a directly connected Shared Link, and if so, on which one.</t>
        </list>
        In addition, a Flooding Delay SHOULD be specified and respected in order to avoid renumbering. If not specified, or whenever the Flooding Mechanism is unable to respect the provided delay, renumbering may happen. As such delay often depends on the size of the network, it MAY change over time and MAY be different from one node to another.
    </t>

    <t>The algorithm ensures that whenever the Flooding Delay is provided and respected, and in the absence of topology change or Delegated Prefix removal, renumbering only happens when a node deliberately overrides an existing assignment.</t>
    
    <t>Each node MUST have a Node ID. Node IDs MAY change over time and be the same on multiple nodes at some point, but each node MUST eventually have a Node ID which is unique among the set of participating nodes.</t>

        <t>This section specifies the prefix assignment algorithm routine. It is defined for a given Delegated Prefix and Link pair and may be run either as triggered by the Backoff Timer or as triggered by another event.</t>
        
        <t>
            For a given Delegated Prefix and Link pair, the routine MUST be run as not triggered by the Backoff Timer whenever:
            <list style="symbols">
                <t>An Advertised Prefix including or included in the considered Delegated Prefix is added or removed.</t>
                <t>An Assigned Prefix included in the considered Delegated Prefix and associated with a different Link than the considered Link was destroyed, while there is no Current Assignment associated with the given pair. This case MAY be ignored if the creation of a new Assigned Prefix associated with the considered pair is not desired.</t>
                <t>The considered Delegated Prefix is added.</t>
                <t>The considered Link is added.</t>
                <t>The Node ID is modified.</t>
            </list>
            
            Additionally, for a given Delegated Prefix and Link pair, the routine MUST be run as triggered by the Backoff Timer whenever:
            <list style="symbols">
                <t>The Backoff Timer associated with the considered Delegated Prefix and Link pair fires while there is no Current Assignment associated with the given pair.</t>
            </list>
        </t>
        
        <t>When such an event occurs, a node MAY delay the execution of the routine instead of executing it immediately, e.g. while receiving an update from the Flooding Mechanism, or for security reasons (see <xref target='security' />). Even though other events occur in the meantime, the routine MUST be run only once. It is also assumed that, whenever one of these events is the Backoff Timer firing, the routine is executed as triggered by the Backoff Timer.</t>
        
        <t>In order to execute the routine for a given Delegated Prefix and Link pair, first look for the Best Assignment and Current Assignment associated with the Delegated Prefix and Link pair, then execute the corresponding case:
            <list style="numbers">
                <t>If there is no Best Assignment and no Current Assignment: Decide whether the creation of a new assignment for the given Delegated Prefix and Link pair is desired (As any result would be valid, the way the decision is made is out of the scope of this document) and do the following:
                    <list style="symbols">
                        <t>If it is not desired, stop the execution of the routine.</t>

                        <t>Else if the routine was not executed as triggered by the Backoff Timer, set the Backoff Timer to some random delay between ADOPT_MAX_DELAY and BACKOFF_MAX_DELAY (see <xref target='variables' />) and stop the execution of the routine.</t>
                        <t>Else, continue the execution of the routine.</t>
                    </list>
                    Select a prefix for the new assignment (see <xref target='random' /> for guidance regarding prefix selection). This prefix MUST be included in or be equal to the considered Delegated Prefix and MUST NOT include or be included in any Advertised Prefix. If a suitable prefix is found, use it to create a new Assigned Prefix:

<section anchor="random" title="Prefix Selection Considerations">
    <t>When the prefix assignment algorithm routine specified in <xref target='algo' /> requires a new prefix to be selected, the prefix MUST be selected either:
            <list style="symbols">
                <t>Among prefixes included in the considered Delegated Prefix which were previously assigned and applied on the considered Link. For that purpose, Applied Prefixes may be stored in stable storage along with their associated Link.</t>
                <t>Randomly, picked in a set of at least RANDOM_SET_SIZE (see <xref target='variables' />) prefixes included in the considered Delegated Prefix and not including or included in any Assigned or Advertised Prefix. If less than RANDOM_SET_SIZE candidates are found, the prefix MUST be picked among all candidates.</t>
                <t>Based on some custom selection process specified in the configuration.</t>
            </list>
        
        A simple implementation MAY randomly pick the prefix among all available prefixes, but this strategy is inefficient in terms of address space use as a few long prefixes may exhaust the pool of available short prefixes.</t>
    
    <t>The rest of this section describes a more efficient approach which MAY be applied any time a node needs to pick a prefix for a new assignment. The two following definitions are used:
        <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Available prefix: ">The prefix A/N is available if and only if it holds the three following conditions:
                    <list style="symbols">
                        <t>It is included in the considered Delegated Prefix.</t>
                        <t>It does not include and is not included in any Assigned or Advertised Prefix but </t>
                        <t>It is equal to the considered Delegated Prefix or A/(N-1) includes an Assigned or Advertised Prefix.</t>
                    </list>
               </t>
            <t hangText="Candidate prefix: ">A prefix of desired length which is included in or is equal to an available prefix.</t>
        </list>
    </t>
    
    <t>The procedure described in this section takes the three following criteria into account:
        <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Stability: ">In some cases, it is desirable that the selected prefix remains the same across executions and reboots. For this purpose, prefixes previously applied on the Link or pseudo-random prefixes generated based on node and Link specific values may be considered.</t>
            <t hangText="Randomness: ">When no stored or pseudo-random prefix is chosen, a prefix may be randomly picked among RANDOM_SET_SIZE candidates of desired length. If less than RANDOM_SET_SIZE candidates can be found, the prefix is picked among all candidates.</t>
            <t hangText="Addressing-space usage efficiency: ">In the process of assigning prefixes, a small set of badly chosen long prefixes may prevent any shorter prefix from being assigned. For this reason, the set of RANDOM_SET_SIZE candidates is created from available prefixes with longest prefix lengths and, in case of tie, preferring small prefix values.</t>
        </list>
    </t>
    
    <t>When executing the procedure, do as follows:
        <list style="numbers">
            <t>For each prefix stored in stable storage, check if the prefix is included in or equal to an available prefix. If so, pick that prefix and stop.</t>
            <t>For each prefix length, count the number of available prefixes of the given length.</t>
            <t>If the desired prefix length was not specified, select one. The available prefixes count computed previously may be used to help picking a prefix length such that:
                    <list style="symbols">
                        <t>There is at least one candidate prefix.</t>
                        <t>The prefix length is chosen great enough to not exhaust the address space.</t>
                    </list>
                Let N be the chosen prefix length.</t>
            <t>Iterate over available prefixes starting with prefixes of length N down to length 0 and create a set of RANDOM_SET_SIZE candidate prefixes of length exactly N included in or equal to available prefixes. The end goal here is to create a set of RANDOM_SET_SIZE candidate prefixes of length N included in a set of available prefixes of maximized prefix length. In case of a tie, smaller prefix values (as defined by the bit-wise lexicographical order) are preferred.</t>
            <t>Generate a set of prefixes of desired length, which are pseudo-randomly chosen based on Node and Link specific values. For each pseudo-random prefix, check if the prefix is equal to a candidate prefix. If so, pick that prefix and stop.</t>
            <t>Choose a random prefix from the set of selected candidates.</t>
        </list>
    </t>
    
    <t>The complexity of this procedure is equivalent to the complexity of iterating over available prefixes. Such operation may be accomplished in linear time, e.g., by storing Advertised and Assigned Prefixes in a binary trie.</t>

<section anchor="behavior" title="Implementation Capabilities and Node Behavior">
    <t>Implementations of the prefix assignment algorithm may vary from very basic to highly customizable, enabling different types of fully interoperable behaviors. The three following behaviors are given as examples:
        <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Listener: ">The node only acts upon assignments made by other nodes, i.e, it never creates new assignments nor adopts existing ones. Such behavior does not require the implementation of the considerations specified in <xref target='random' /> or <xref target='override' />. The node never checks existing assignments validity, which makes this behavior particularly suited to lightweight devices which can rely on more capable neighbors to make assignments on directly connected Shared Links.</t>
            <t hangText="Basic: ">The node is capable of assigning new prefixes or adopting prefixes which do not conflict with any other existing assignment. Such behavior does not require the implementation of the considerations specified in <xref target='override' />. It is suited to situations where there is no preference over which prefix should be assigned to which Link, and there is no priority between different Links.</t>
            <t hangText="Advanced: ">The node is capable of assigning new prefixes, adopting existing ones, making overriding assignments and destroying existing ones. Such behavior requires the implementation of the considerations specified in <xref target='random' /> and <xref target='override' />. It is suited when the administrator desires some particular prefix to be assigned on a given Link, or some Links to be assigned prefixes with a greater priority.</t>

<section anchor="variables" title="Algorithm Parameters">
    <t>This document does not provide values for ADOPT_MAX_DELAY, BACKOFF_MAX_DELAY and RANDOM_SET_SIZE. The algorithm ensures convergence and correctness for any chosen values, even when these are different from node to node. They MAY be adjusted depending on the context, providing a tradeoff between convergence time, efficient addressing, low verbosity (less traffic is generated by the Flooding Mechanism), and low collision probability.</t>
    
    <t>ADOPT_MAX_DELAY (respectively BACKOFF_MAX_DELAY) represents the maximum backoff time a node may wait before adopting an assignment (respectively making a new assignment). BACKOFF_MAX_DELAY MUST be greater than or equal to ADOPT_MAX_DELAY. The greater ADOPT_MAX_DELAY and (BACKOFF_MAX_DELAY - ADOPT_MAX_DELAY), the lower the collision probability and the verbosity, but the greater the convergence time.</t>
    <t>RANDOM_SET_SIZE represents the desired size of the set a random prefix will be picked from. The greater RANDOM_SET_SIZE, the better the convergence time and the lower the collision probability, but the worse the addressing-space usage efficiency.</t>
    
    <t>When the Flooding Mechanism does not provide a Flooding Delay, it is set to DEFAULT_FLOODING_DELAY. As participating nodes do not need to agree on a common Flooding Delay value, this default value MAY be different from one node to another. If the context in which the algorithm is used does not suffer from renumbering, the value 0 MAY be used. Otherwise it depends on the Flooding Mechanism properties and the desired renumbering probability, and is therefore out of scope of this document.</t>

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
    <t>The prefix assignment algorithm functions on top of two distinct mechanisms, the Flooding Mechanism and the Node ID assignment mechanism.
        <list>
            <t>An attacker able to publish Advertised Prefixes through the Flooding Mechanism may perform the following attacks:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>Publish a single overriding assignment for a whole Delegated Prefix or for the whole address space, thus preventing any node from assigning prefixes to Links.</t>
                    <t>Quickly publish and remove Advertised Prefixes, generating traffic at the Flooding Mechanism layer and causing multiple executions of the prefix assignment algorithm in all participating nodes.</t>
                    <t>Publish and remove Advertised Prefixes in order to prevent the convergence of the execution.</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>An attacker able to prevent other nodes from accessing a portion or the whole set of Advertised Prefixes may compromise the correctness of the execution.</t>
            <t>An attacker able to cause repetitive Node ID changes may induce traffic generation from the Flooding Mechanism and multiple executions of the prefix assignment algorithm in all participating nodes.</t>
            <t>An attacker able to publish Advertised Prefixes using a Node ID used by another node may prevent the correctness and convergence of the execution.</t>
        </list>
    </t>
    <t>Whenever the security of the Flooding Mechanism and Node ID assignment mechanism could not be ensured, the convergence of the execution may be prevented. In environments where such attacks may be performed, the execution of the prefix assignment algorithm routine SHOULD be rate limited, as specified in <xref target='algo' />.</t>

<section anchor="static" title="Static Configuration Example">
    <t>This section describes an example of how custom configuration of the prefix assignment algorithm may be implemented.</t>
    <t>The node configuration is specified as a finite set of rules. A rule is defined as:
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>A prefix to be used.</t>
            <t>A Link on which the prefix may be assigned.</t>
            <t>An Assigned Prefix Priority (smallest possible Assigned Prefix Priority if the rule may not override other Assigned Prefixes).</t>
            <t>A rule priority (0 if the rule may not override existing Advertised Prefixes).</t>
        </list>
        
        In order to ensure the convergence of the execution, the Assigned Prefix Priority MUST be an increasing function (not necessarily strictly) of the configuration rule priority (i.e. the greater is the configuration rule priority, the greater the Assigned Prefix Priority must be).
    </t>
    <t>Each Assigned Prefix is associated with a rule priority. Assigned Prefixes which are created as specified in <xref target='algo' /> are given a rule priority of 0.</t>
    <t>Whenever the configuration is changed or the prefix assignment algorithm routine is run: For each Link/Delegated Prefix pair, look for the configuration rule with the highest configuration rule priority such that:
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>The prefix specified in the configuration rule is included in the considered Delegated Prefix.</t>
            <t>The Link specified in the configuration rule is the considered Link.</t>
            <t>All the Assigned Prefixes which would need to be destroyed in case a new Assigned Prefix is created from that configuration rule (as specified in <xref target='override' />) have an associated rule priority which is strictly lower than the one of the considered configuration rule.</t>
            <t>The assignment would be valid when published with an Advertised Prefix Priority equal to the one specified in the configuration rule.</t>
        </list>
        If a rule is found, a new Assigned Prefix is created based on that rule in conformance with <xref target='override' />. The new Assigned Prefix is associated with the Advertised Prefix Priority and the rule priority specified in the considered configuration rule.
    </t>
    
    <t>Note that the use of rule priorities ensures the convergence of the execution.</t>
