<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
    <t>Hosts may have multiple non-link-local addresses, possibly provided by different routers located on one or multiple links. In such situations, hosts must make sure packets with a given source address are sent to the right next-hop router. Failing in selecting the right next-hop router may, at best, induce sub-optimal routing and, at worst, cause the packet to be dropped (<xref target="RFC2827"/>). Rules 5 and 5.5 from the default address selection algorithm <xref target="RFC6724"/> make sure that, once the next-hop is chosen, care is taken to pick the right source address. Nevertheless, these rules may fail in some situations, e.g., when the same prefix is advertised on the same link by different routers. Additionally, they don't handle situations where the application picks the source-address before sending the packet.</t>
    
    <t>This document defines the Source Address Dependent Route Information Option for Router Advertisements <xref target="RFC4861"/>, enabling source address dependent routes to be installed in hosts by neighboring routers. It also adds a new flag to the Route Information Option meaning that the option may be ignored by hosts implementing this specification.</t>
</section>
    
<section anchor="SADRIO" title="Source Address Dependent Route Information Option">
    
        <t>This section defines a new Router Advertisement option called the Source Address Dependent Route Information option. Its use is similar to the Route Information option defined in <xref target="RFC4191"/> but also includes additional source prefix fields, allowing source address dependent routes to be installed on hosts receiving the Router Advertisement.</t>

    </t>

        <t>Note: Comments have been made regarding address alignment. There is no format providing at the same time good alignment and optimal TLV size, while aligning both source and destination prefixes would waste from 7 to 21 bytes per option. This TLV format is proposed based on implementation experience and provides both TLV size efficiency, and relative compatibility with the Route Information option (Linux implementation of this option support is less than 100 lines of code).</t>
        <t>Comments and propositions are welcome regarding which format to adopt.</t>

<section anchor="RIOflag" title="Route Information Option ignore flag">
    
    <t>
        This document adds the Ignore flag to the Route Information option specified in <xref target="RFC4191"/>. It is used in order to configure type C hosts with more specific routes which will be ignored by hosts implementing this specification. Most of the time, such options with the I bit set will be used in conjunction with Source Address Dependent Route Information options including the same or a similar destination prefix.

<section anchor="host" title="Host Behavior">

    <t>Hosts implementing this specification are referred to as type D hosts, in reference to host types A, B and C defined in <xref target="RFC4191"/>. As a reminder, type A hosts are hosts behaving as specified in <xref target="RFC4191"/>. Type B hosts behave similarly to type A hosts with the addition that they act upon the Default Router Preference values present in Router Advertisement headers. Finally, type C hosts behave as type B hosts with the addition that they act upon received Route Information Options.</t>

    <t>This section specifies type D hosts behavior. Type D hosts MUST behave as type C hosts unless stated otherwise in this section. For the sake of clarity, in this whole section, 'host' refers to 'type D host'.</t>
    
    <t>Hosts MUST use a Routing Table with source address dependent entries. Such entries have a:
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>Source prefix</t>
            <t>Destination prefix</t>
            <t>Preference value</t>
            <t>Interface</t>
            <t>Next-hop router address</t>
            <t>Lifetime and associated timer</t>
        </list></t>

    <section anchor="hostsend" title="Selecting the next-hop router">
        <t>When sending a packet, hosts MUST select the next-hop router based on the usual source address dependent routing algorithm, i.e., by picking the matching entry with, by order of precedence:
            <list>
                <t>The longest destination address match.</t>
                <t>The longest source address match.</t>
                <t>The greatest route preference value.</t>
            </list>
            In case of a tie, hosts MAY either pick one entry or use load-sharing techniques.
        </t>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="rSADRIO" title="Receiving Source Address Dependent Route Information option">
    
    <t>
        When receiving a Source Address Dependent Route Information option, a host MUST look for an existing routing entry with:
        <list style="numbers">
            <t>The same source prefix.</t>
            <t>The same destination prefix.</t>
            <t>The next-hop router address equal to the source address of the received Router Advertisement.</t>
            <t>The outgoing interface equal to the interface the Router Advertisement is received on.</t>
        </list>
    </t>
    
    <t>If no routing entry is found and the Route Lifetime is not null, insert a routing entry with the given source prefix, destination prefix, route preference, having as next-hop the source address of the received Router Advertisement, on the interface receiving the packet. If the Route Lifetime is not infinity, set the routing entry timer to the Route Lifetime value.</t>
    <t>If a routing entry is found and the Route Lifetime is not null, cancel the associated timer. If the Route Lifetime is not infinity, set the timer to the Route Lifetime value. Finally, update the entry preference with the Route Preference value.</t>
    <t>If a routing entry is found and the Route Lifetime is null, remove the routing entry.</t>
    
    <t>If both destination and source prefixes specified by the option are ::/0, the router preference and route lifetime present in the option overrides the default router lifetime and default router preference present in the header of the Router Advertisement.</t>

    </section>
    
    <section anchor="rRIO" title="Receiving Route Information options">
    <t>
        When receiving a Route Information option, a host MUST behave as follows:
        <list>
            <t>If the I bit is set, ignore the option.</t>
            <t>Otherwise, act as when receiving a Source Address Dependent Route Information option with source prefix length set to zero.</t>
        </list>
    </t>
    </section>

</section>

<section anchor="router" title="Router Behavior">
    <t>Routers MAY send one or multiple Source Address Dependent Route Information options in their Router Advertisements.</t>
    
    <t>Routers MUST NOT send multiple Route Information options with the same Prefix (no matter what the Ignore flag value is) or multiple Source Address Dependent Route Information options with the same Source and Destination Prefixes. Additionally, routers MUST NOT send a Route Information option with the Ignore bit not set and a Source Address Dependent Route Information with the source length equal to zero if the Prefix from the Route Information option is equal to the Destination Prefix from the Source Address Dependent Route Information option.</t>
    
    <t>The Ignore bit is used to configure hosts implementing this specification differently from other types of hosts (A, B or C). Different combinations will result in different behaviors. For instance:
        <list>
        <t>
            When injecting a source address dependent route is desired, a Source Address Dependent Route Information option is sent in every RA. Depending on the context, a Route Information with the same prefix and the Ignore bit set MAY be sent as well in order to inject a non source address dependent route into type C hosts. Obviously, Source Address Dependent Route Information options can be used to inject non-source dependent routes as well. This technique and the use of the Ignore bit allow type C hosts and type D hosts to be configured with possibly independent routes.
        </t>
        <t>
            When injecting a non source address dependent route is desired, the router MAY either use a Route Information option with the Ignore flag not set, in which case both type C and D hosts will be configured, or use a Source Address Dependent Route Information option with a source prefix ::/0, in which case type C hosts will not be configured.
        </t>
        </list>
    </t>
    <t>When a Source Address Dependent Route Information option is removed from the set of advertised options, or when the interface ceases to be an advertising interface, the router SHOULD send up to MAX_INITIAL_RTR_ADVERTISEMENTS unsolicited Router Advertisements, using the same rule as in <xref target="RFC2461"/>, with the Route Lifetime set to zero in all Source Address Dependent Route Information options that have become invalid.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
    <t>This document allows routers to configure neighboring hosts with source address dependent routing entries. Based on <xref target="RFC4191"/>, attackers can inject default routes to type A and B hosts as well as destination address dependent routes to type C hosts. The Source Address Dependent Route Information option adds the ability for attackers to inject even more specific routes, making attacks slightly harder to detect.</t>
</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
    <t>IANA is kindly asked to reserve a Router Advertisement option type to be used by the Source Address Dependent Route Information option.</t>
