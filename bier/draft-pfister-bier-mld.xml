<abstract>
    <t>This document specifies the BIER Multicast Listener Discovery (BMLD) Protocol, which adapts the Multicast Listener Discovery protocol version 2 (MLDv2) to be used over BIER, enabling state sharing from egress routers, acting as listeners, toward ingress routers, acting as queriers. Ingress routers keep per-egress-router multicast subscription state, used to construct the BIER bit mask inserted to multicast packets entering the BIER domain.</t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
    <t>The Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) forwarding scheme enables multicast forwarding within a BIER domain. When receiving or generating a packet, ingress routers have to construct a bit mask indicating which BIER egress routers located within the same BIER domain will receive the packet. A stateless approach would consist in forwarding all incoming packets toward all egress routers, which would in turn make a forwarding decision based on local information. But any more efficient approach would require ingress routers to keep some state about egress routers multicast subscriptions, hence requiring state sharing from egress routers toward ingress routers.</t>

    <t>State sharing techniques inspired from existing multicast routing protocols such as PIMv2 <xref target='RFC4601' /> would require intermediate routers to keep subscription states, which is undesirable as BIER does not need such state on intermediate routers. On the other hand, the Multicast Listener Discovery protocol version 2 <xref target='RFC3810' /> is widely available and has multiple interoperable implementations, but is only able to share multicast subscription state between routers and hosts connected on the same link.</t>

    <t>This document specifies the BIER Multicast Listener Discovery (BMLD) Protocol, which adapts the Multicast Listener Discovery protocol version 2 (MLDv2) to be used over BIER, enabling state sharing from egress routers, acting as listeners, toward ingress routers, acting as queriers. Ingress routers keep per-egress-router multicast subscription state, used to construct the BIER bit mask inserted to multicast packets entering the BIER domain.</t>

<section anchor="overview" title="Overview">

    <t>This document proposes to use the mechanisms described in MLDv2 in order to enable multicast subscription state sharing from BFERs toward BFIRs within a given BIER domain. BMLD queries (resp. reports) are sent over BIER toward all BMLD Nodes (resp. BMLD Queriers) using modified MLDv2 messages which IPv6 destination is set to a configured 'all BMLD Nodes' (resp. 'all BMLD Queriers') IPv6 multicast address.</t>

    <t>By running MLDv2 instances with per-listener explicit tracking, BMLD Queriers are able to map BMLD Listeners (The BFR-Prefix is used as source address in all BMLD reports) with MLDv2 subscription states. This state is then used to construct the set of BFERs for each incoming IPv6 multicast data packet.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="as" title="Applicability Statement">
    <t>The BMLD protocol runs on top of a BIER Layer and provides the BFIR part of the services provided by a Multicast Flow Overlay (The BIER layering architecture is described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-bier-architecture"/>), i.e, it specifies how BFIRs construct the set of BFERs for each ingress IPv6 multicast data packet. The BFER part of the Multicast Flow Overlay is out of scope of this document.</t>

    <t>The BIER Layer MUST be able to transport BMLD messages toward all BMLD Queriers and Listeners. Such packets are IPv6 multicast packets with a BFR-id as source address, a multicast destination address, and containing a MLDv2 message.</t>

    <t>The BMLD protocol only requires state to be kept by Queriers, and is therefore more scalable in terms of overall state, but is also likely to be less scalable than PIMv2 in terms of the amount of control traffic and the size of the state that is kept by individual routers.</t>

    <t>The whole protocol can be adapted to IPv4 multicast, as specified in <xref target='IPv4' />.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="specs" title="Querier and Listener Specifications">
    <t>Routers desiring to receive IPv6 multicast traffic (e.g., for their own use, or for forwarding) MUST behave as BMLD Listeners. Routers receiving IPv6 multicast traffic from outside the BIER domain, or locally generating multicast traffic, MUST behave as BMLD Queriers.</t>

    <t>BMLD Queriers (resp. BMLD Listeners) MUST act as MLDv2 Queriers (resp. MLDv2 Listeners) as specified in <xref target="RFC3810"/> unless stated otherwise in this section.</t>

    <section title="Configuration Parameters">
        <t>Both Queriers and Listeners MUST be able to operate as BFIRs and BFERs within the BIER domain, and MUST therefore be configured accordingly, as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-bier-architecture"/>.</t>

        <t>All Listeners MUST be configured with a 'all BMLD Queriers' multicast address and the BFR-ids of all the BMLD Queriers. This is used by Listeners to send BMLD Reports over BIER toward all Queriers.</t>

        <t>All Queriers MUST be configured with a 'all BMLD Nodes' multicast address and the BFR-ids of all the Queriers and Listeners. This information is used by Queriers to send BMLD queries over BIER toward all BMLD Nodes.</t>

        <t>Note that BMLD (unlike MLDv2) makes use of per-instance configured multicast group addresses rather than well-known addresses so that multiple instances of BMLD (using different group addresses) can be run simultaneously within the same BIER domain. Configured group addresses MAY be obtained from allocated IPv6 prefixes using <xref target="RFC3306"/>.</t>

        <t>IPv6 packets coming from outside of the BIER domain and having a destination address set to the configured 'all BMLD Queriers' or the 'all BMLD Nodes' group address MUST be dropped. It is RECOMMENDED that these configured addresses have a limited scope, enforcing this behavior by scope-based filtering on BIER domain's egress interfaces.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="MLDv2 instances.">
        <t>BMLD Queriers MUST run a MLDv2 Querier instance with per-host tracking, which means they keep track of the MLDv2 state associated with each BMLD Listener. For that purpose, Listeners are identified by their respective BFR-Prefixes, used as IPv6 source address in all BMLD reports.</t>

        <t>BMLD Listeners MUST run a MLDv2 Listener instance expressing their interest in the multicast traffic they are supposed to receive for local use or forwarding.</t>

        <t>BMLD Listeners and Queriers MUST NOT run the MLDv1 backward compatibility procedures.</t>

        <section title="Sending Queries">
